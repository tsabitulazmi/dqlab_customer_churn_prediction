# DQLab Machine Learning Project: Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my Data Science and Analytics learning path in DQLab.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to creating customer churn prediction model using machine learning approximation and choose what is the best model or algorithm to model it. <br>
Churn meaning wether the customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time.

## There are several steps in this project:
- Import data and library needed
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outlier, duplicates, invalid format)
- Exploration Data Analysis
- Data Preparation (encoding, split train and test)
- Modelling using 3 algorithm : Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boost Classifier
- Choose the best model based on the model evaluation (classification_report, confusion_matrix)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11.4
- numpy 1.25.1
- pandas 2.0.3
- matplotlib 3.7.2
- seaborn 0.12.2
- scikit-learn 1.3.0
